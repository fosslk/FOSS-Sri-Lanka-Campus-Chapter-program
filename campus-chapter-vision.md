That is the vision for Campus Chapter. To spark a movement -- a loud voice, a breeding ground for new ideas, a massive force, a deep talent pool -- that powers the open web to new heights.

At the start of each year, Campus Chapter plan the impact they want to have for the open web and then hack and build on a combination of activities and open-source projects to make a difference for the web, their campuses and communities.
