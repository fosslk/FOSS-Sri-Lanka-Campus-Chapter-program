### 3. Story

The Free Open Source Software movement began in the early 1980’s with the advent of the “Software freedom movement “ by Richard Stallman. Richard went on to create the GNU project and Free Software Foundation to further his vision, not to mention some pretty good software. It took several more decades, but beginning in the early 2000’s it became clear to most people that the free software vision was consolidating mind share around the world.

Free, open-source operating systems such as GNU, Linux and BSD are widely utilized today, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones (e.g. Google Android), and other devices. Free software licenses and open-source licenses are used in many software packages.
The Aim of the Starting Free Open Source Society is Contribute to the Society with Developments and New Concepts and make people as a part of one of the world’s largest communities.
